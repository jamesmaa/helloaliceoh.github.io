          Sobrr was founded in February 2014 by Bruce Yang and Vivian Xu, former veterans of LinkedIn, Fitbit, and Microsoft. They worked from their home office in Emeryville with a small team of UC Berkeley students and alumni until Sobrr received $1.1 million in Seed funding led by

          most human beings can hold only about 150 meaningful relationships in their heads. Sobrr is a social network for meeting and interacting with new people without theâ€¨ unrealistic expectation of permanent friendship. People can share interests, chat, and exchange photos during the temporary friendship period to get to know one another better before deciding whether they want to keep the friendship or not.
          <br><br>
          Sobrr is a location-based 24-hour social networking app. Users can view and share photos publicly or with people nearby, then send a friend request to people who they want to chat with to get to know better. All interactions and exchanges will only last for 24 hours before they expire unless mutually kept.

          and more). We reached out to our users and conducted user research and survey to better understand our audience -- responses, behaviors, comments, questions, demographics: Why are they using the product and what is their most used feature? How long is each session and how often do they open the app? How many friends does an average user have and how many chat messages are exchaged during their 24-hour friendship? User feedback provided insight and direction for our feature releases and shaped our branding.
          <br><br>
          Our user tracking data also showed that, among the three main action features -- photo sharing, chat, and friending -- chat was driving the most engagement. Also, users who send chat messages within the first week of sign up tend to have a higher retention rate than those who did not. We took this into consideration as we did a app redesign for iOS and launched the Android app.

          When our product designers left the team, I had the chance to dab into design as the Android redesign project was not yet fully fleshed out.

          Original design: Because we had already planned to move out of the hamburger slide-out menu design to the tab bar design for the iOS in order to create equal accessibility to Sobrr's main features (i.e. vibe sharing, starting a chat, friending), the Android launched with spinner placed at the top action bar. Users can change tabs with swipe views.

          </div>
          <br>
          New design: A lot of the design is polished out. The tab bar navigation is visible at the top, which users can swipe through, along with other specific action buttons (ex. notifications, filters, search) at the top. The main anticipated action button (ex. vibe sharing, searching people nearby, starting a chat) is moved to the bottom, more easily accessible by the thumb. Copy has been changed to increase clarity and encourage action.
